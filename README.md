# Cisco ACI

### jcoeder's copy to work out of because git

## Description

A basic pack for working with Cisco ACI systems using the Restful API. Most of the actions are
coded to take the same input and just actions their associated part. This is for 2 reasons:

* keeps the input simpler and cleaner
* all the required information such as Tenant, AP etc is always included.

## Connection Configuration

Copy the sample configuration file [cisco_aci.yaml.example](./cisco_aci.yaml.example) to
`/opt/stackstorm/configs/cisco_aci.yaml` and edit as required.

The config file requires details for connecting to an APIC, Address, username and password.
It is recommended that a read only account be setup and used for these tasks. This allows any
of the get actions to be performed without requiring a dedicated user.

It is recommended that for any set/create actions that suitable accounts be passed in
the `credentials` parameter. This allows for an audit trail within ACI.

## Workflows

* `cisco_aci.setup_epg` - Setup an EPG with all associated Application Profiles, Bridge Domains,
  Static Bindings and Domain Links

## Aliases

* `cisco_aci.find_mac` - Find a MAC address in the fabric
* `cisco_aci.find_ip` - Find an IP address in the fabric

## Sample Input

Most create states use the same format of input. This is a sample of how that input should look:

```jsonc
{
  "tenant1": {  # Tenant name
    "tenant1-AP1": {  # Application Profile
      "tenant1-BD102": {  # Bridge Domain
        "vrf": "tenant1-VRF1",  # VRF name
        "epgs": {
          "tenant1-EPG102": {  # EPG name
            "desc": "Tenant 1 EPG 102",  # EPG description
            "domains": ["VM1", "PHYS"],  # Domains to associate with
            "static_bindings": {
              "103":  # VLAN number
                [{"leaf1": 46}, {"leaf2": 46}]  # Leaf/ports to associate
            }
          },
          "tenant1-EPG103": {
            "desc": "Tenant 1 EPG 103",
            "domains": ["VM1", "PHYS"],
            "static_bindings": {
              "104": [{"leaf1": 46}, {"leaf2": 46}]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "tenant1-AP2": {
      "tenant1-BD202": {
        "vrf": "tenant1-VRF1",
        "epgs": {
          "tenant1-EPG202": {
            "desc": "Tenant 1 EPG 202",
            "domains": ["VM1", "PHYS"],
            "static_bindings": {
              "103": [{"leaf1": 46}, {"leaf2": 46}]
            }
          },
          "tenant1-EPG203": {
            "desc": "Tenant 1 EPG 203",
            "domains": ["VM1", "PHYS"],
            "static_bindings": {
              "104": [{"leaf1": 47}, {"leaf2": 47}]
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## ACI Setup Assumptions:

### Naming conventions

* Application Profile - <Tenant>-AP<unique number> eg. tenant1-AP1
* Bridge Domain - <Tenant>-BD<app number><unique number> eg. tenant1-BD102
* EPG - <Tenant>-EPG<app number><unique number> eg. tenant1-EPG102
* VRF - <Tenant>-VRF<unique number> eg. tenant1-VRF1

Very few of these naming conventions are enforced within the ACI actions,
although they are the basis on which the actions were made.

### Only Create New

The first incarnation of this pack will only create that which does not exist.
If any of the elements are already present, the action will continue without making
any changes.

### Static bindings

The create static binding action makes the assumption that the following associations
are in place:

* Leaves are associated with a Switch Policy > Profile > Leaf Profile
* This is then associated with an Interface Selector Profile (Interface Policies > Profiles > Leaf Profile)
* The port is added to a Access Port Selector under the Interface Policy
* The Policy Group for the Access Port Selector contains the Tenant within the name

### VRF

Within the input the VRF parameter is optional. If this is omitted the default fallback is "tenant"-VRF1.

### Physical Domain String for static bindings

When defining a domain you can specify a tdn that will be used during the static binding creation.
However if the domain type is `PHYS` and no tdn is provided it will use the following format to
create one:

`uni/phys-Managed-Hosting-<tenant>-Domain<number at end of Ap>`
